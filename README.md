This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying breast cancer using histopathological images. The goal is to develop a machine learning or deep learning model that can accurately predict whether a tissue sample contains cancerous cells based on its microscopic image.

## Overview

This project addresses the critical task of breast cancer detection using image analysis. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to create an automated system that can assist pathologists in the diagnostic process. This can potentially lead to faster and more accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset

*(Provide specific details about the dataset used in this project. Include information such as the source, size, and any preprocessing steps applied. If the dataset is publicly available, provide a link.)*

For example:

> The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis)](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/). It consists of a collection of microscopic images of breast tumor tissue samples. The dataset contains [mention the number] images, categorized into benign and malignant classes. The images have been acquired at different magnification factors (40x, 100x, 200x, 400x). We have performed preprocessing steps such as [mention any preprocessing, e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*(List any software, libraries, or tools that need to be installed before running the project.)*

For example:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (see Installation section)

### Installation

*(Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project environment.)*

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/BCC-project/breast_cancer_classification-_img.git](https://github.com/BCC-project/breast_cancer_classification-_img.git)
   cd breast_cancer_classification-_img
````

2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```
3.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  (If necessary) Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (`data/raw/` or as specified in the `Dataset` section).

## Usage

*(Provide instructions on how to run the code for different tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.)*

For example:

  - **Data Preprocessing:**

    ```bash
    python src/data_loading.py --input_dir data/raw/ --output_dir data/processed/
    ```

    (Modify the command with appropriate arguments if your script requires them)

  - **Model Training:**

    ```bash
    python src/training.py --config config/model_config.yaml --output_dir models/
    ```

    (Explain any configuration files or command-line arguments)

  - **Model Evaluation:**

    ```bash
    python src/evaluation.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --data_path data/processed/test.csv --metrics_dir reports/metrics/
    ```

    (Provide examples for evaluating the trained model)

  - **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    You can also explore the project and run the code using the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Model Architecture (if applicable)

*(If you have a specific model architecture, describe it here. Include details about the layers, activation functions, and any specific design choices. You can also include a diagram if it helps in visualization.)*

For example:

> The model used for classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the [mention the base architecture, e.g., VGG16, ResNet50] architecture. It consists of the following layers:
>
> 1.  [Describe the first convolutional block]
> 2.  [Describe the subsequent layers]
> 3.  [Mention the fully connected layers and the output layer]
>
> We have used [mention activation functions, e.g., ReLU] as the activation function for most layers and [mention the output activation, e.g., sigmoid] for the final classification layer. [Mention any regularization techniques used, e.g., dropout, batch normalization].

## Results (if available)

*(Present the results of your model's performance. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any relevant visualizations like confusion matrices or ROC curves.)*

For example:

> The trained model achieved the following performance on the test set:
>
>   - Accuracy: [XX.XX]%
>   - Precision (Malignant): [XX.XX]%
>   - Recall (Malignant): [XX.XX]%
>   - F1-score (Malignant): [XX.XX]%
>   - Precision (Benign): [XX.XX]%
>   - Recall (Benign): [XX.XX]%
>   - F1-score (Benign): [XX.XX]%
>
